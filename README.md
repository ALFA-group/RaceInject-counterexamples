The counterexamples, which are generated by our method `RaceInjector`, are program execution traces with a guaranteed race condition in them which recent race detection algorithms fail to detect.

### Folder structure

`treeset_orig`, `arraylist_orig`, and `jigsaw_orig` are the original _base traces_ collected by Calfuzzer.

These traces correspond to the following program benchmarks:
- TreeSet 
- ArrayList
- JigSaw 

The race detection algorithms evaluated are:
- [SyncP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434317)
- [WCP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02432.pdf)
- [HB](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf)
- [SHB](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3276515)

For each algorithm, the folder `./{algorithm}_missed` contains counterexamples generated for each programming benchmark.  
For example, for SyncP, `syncp_missed/treeset` contains all the traces generated from the `TreeSet` base trace that contain a race condition which `SyncP` fails to detect.
