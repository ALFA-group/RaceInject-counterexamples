# RaceInject-counterexamples
Counterexamples to several most recent race detection algorithms generated by RaceInjector.

### Structure
treeset\_orig, arraylist\_orig, and jigsaw\_orig are the original base traces collected by Calfuzzer. 
The projects we used to generate these are:
- TreeSet 
- ArrayList
- JigSaw. 

The algorithms we evaluated are:
- [SyncP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434317)
- [WCP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02432.pdf)
- [HB](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf)
- [SHB](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3276515)

For each algorithm {algorithm}\_missed is the folder containing the counterexamples for each project. So for SyncP, `syncp\_missed/treeset` contains all the races generated from the TreeSet base trace that are missed by SyncP.
